    <h1>Vision For the Future</h1>
    <p>After seeing what coding can do and what capabilities it has to create, I have wanted to 
        <br><br> make games that don't require another gaming engine to do so. What I also have wanted
        <br><br> to is to create games or even robot's with AI's that seem enough human to create a sense 
        <br><br> that they actually exist.
    </p>
    <h1>Future Projects</h1>
    <p> Seeing as I have always loved video games, one of my projects I would love to do at some point
        <br><br> would be different types of VR / interactive AR games. For example, I love high detail
        <br><br> and graphics so creating a cooking based game with physics on how each food interacts 
        <br><br> with everything and reflections and good lighting helping with a sense of realism.
        <br><br> A large project that will probably be done by someone else in the future would be the 
        <br><br> interactive AI. The ability to have in game characters and creatures seem more real would
        <br><br> move games into a better direction with more uniqueness for each world or server.
