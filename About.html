    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        When I was a smol child, I loved to play video games in my free time and was able to figure any game out quickly.
        <br><br>Thats when I was introduced to Minecraft, a game where only the sky was the limit and soon started making
        <br><br>builds, <a href="secret.html" title="?">secret</a> areas, and tinkering with redstone. With redstone came command blocks, a block that alowed you to  
        <br><br>change how the game worked and alowed you to create games or more intricate contraptions that you could think of.
        <br><br> Roblox was introduced and alowed me to code whatever I could think of. I currently work on small things in
        <br><br> diffrent projects and have it move slowly but surely twords a finish.
        <br><br>I finish high school in 2022 and plan on finishing colage in 2024. I worked a short while in retail and gained
        <br><br> some work knowlage from there. I currently create and edit videos for several social media platforms
